FlyLab Software (formerly Flyatar2)
-------------------------------------

This software is (i.e. hopes to be) the foundation software platform of 
the Dickinson Lab.  

At the moment it provides a platform for virtual reality environments that 
may consist of some combination of robot-magnet actuators, laser-galvo steering, 
realtime multifly tracking & visual servoing, an experiment library & examples 
thereof, data-logging of fly & robot states, and other related pieces.

A focus has been to enable easy operation across multiple machines and multiple 
experimental hardware platforms, and as such each piece of experimental hardware 
has a directory in the "config" package.  There you will find all the relevant
parameters, etc, needed for the software to operate on a given piece of hardware.  
To have the software use a given piece of hardware, simply point 
config/config/launch/hardware.launch to the name of your hardware.  Calibration 
and setup of the hardware is in the file calibration.txt.

There is also a set of experiments, and an experiment library, in the "experiments" 
package.  An experiment is specified by filling out a data structure in the 
appropriate <experimentname>.py file, and then roslaunch'ing the appropriate 
.launch file.  The experiments library has been written with the intention that 
a wide variety of experiments are possible via this data structure.
